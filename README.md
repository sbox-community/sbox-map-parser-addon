# sbox-map-parser-addon
Map Parser for s&amp;box


Known issues;
- Physical and walking animation issues on the map
- Lighting and non-transparent texture problems ( when figuring out to implement the shader with map's lightmap, will be fixed )
- Freezing until creating textures are finished ( waiting for above shader implementation ) 
- UI delay/freezing problems ( when addons system get fixed, might be fixed )

Posible updates;
- Lightmap ( already implemented, waiting for the shader )
- Removing of env_sprite, water or trigger's physics
- Functionality of some entities ( like ambient sounds, buttons, doors or lights )
- Sky ( need a shader or render hook )
- Demo player ( for goldsrc )
- Model and Particle parser ( for goldsrc )
- Another game map parsers ( maybe source engine? )
